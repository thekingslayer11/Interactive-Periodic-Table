# Interactive-Periodic-Table<br>        The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus), electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties.<br>        Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number, which is typically listed with the chemical symbol in each box. The standard form of the table consists of a grid of elements laid out in 18 columns and 7 rows, with a double row of elements below that. The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks: the s-block to the left, the p-block to the right, the d-block in the middle, and the f-block below that.\n    Project Elements was made using the Java programming language(Netbeans IDE) and a Relational Database MySQL and we have created an immersive, interactive and user-friendly interface to learn about the Periodic Table of Elements.\n   The values in the related databases contain few predicted values (for radioactive elements)to provide better search results. The format of the periodic table is the one published by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) in May 2013(latest)\n\nSOURCES\n1. iupac.org\n2. wikipedia.org\n3. americanelements.com\n4. mrbigler.com\n5. periodictable.com<br>
